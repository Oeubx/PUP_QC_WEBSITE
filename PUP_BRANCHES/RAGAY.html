                The sole PUP branch in the Southeastern Luzon, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Ragay Branch is situated atop of a hill in Barangay Lower Sta. Cruz, Ragay, Camarines Sur. Its legal foundation is R.A. 7645, otherwise known as "The General Appropriations Act of 1993".
                <br><br>
                It was built through the initiative and altruistic endeavor of the late Hon. Rolando R. Andaya, Sr., then Congressman of the First District of Camarines Sur and Chairman of the House of Appropriations Committee.
                <br><br>
                Since then, PUP-Ragay has been actively part of the region in different aspects of social services, networking and linkages, cultural and academic endeavor. The Bachelor of Science in Accountancy has then produced efficient Certified Public Accountants serving both in the national and local governments and private agencies.
                <br><br>
                Today, it flourishes to sustain its aspiration for academic excellence-padagos sa pagsirang!
